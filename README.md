## Starting my journey to learn this horrible language with the help of [lowlevelacademy](https://lowlevel.academy/).

### __Ok but it is a cool course and all in all i would recommend it, lowlevelcoding is great plus he uses ```neovim btw```__

This will be all the coourses into one repo, it would look better having 4 C repos in my github but does it really matter? Just use rust.

# Network Applications in C

This is the final project for the course, it is a simple network application that can be used to view and edit a local database.
